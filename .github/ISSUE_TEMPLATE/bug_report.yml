        Before opening an issue, please search for all open and closed Github issues as well as any
        relevant discussion topics that may match your situation.
        
        Please **DO NOT** open bugs for simple howto usage questions or basic operational issues such
        as "I can't get the live stream to work". Such issues should be directed to the [discussion groups](https://github.com/PatrickSt1991/ring-recorder/discussions) 
        instead.
        
        Please **DO NOT** open bugs if you are not prepared to provide logs or answer questions in a
        timely manner (at least every few days).  Issues that receive no followup responses will be
        subject to closure after 72 hours.
        
        Please include the information requested in the fields below completely as possible or the issue will
        likely be closed immediately.
